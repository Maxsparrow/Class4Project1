##Plots and plot scripts for Exploratory Data Analysis course project 1

Run each plot script - plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, and plot4.R to create the 4 required plots for this course in your working directory. 

Each function downloads the needed file, subsets it to only contain the data we need, and then modifies it to make the data more tidy.

Then each function creates 1 plot in a .png file depending on what was needed to recreate the instructor's plots.
